Far-field Voice Assistant
#########################

********
Overview
********

These are the XCORE-VOICE far-field voice assistant example designs demonstrating:

- 2-microphone far-field voice assistant front-end
- Audio pipeline including echo cancelation, interference cancelling and noise suppression
- Stereo reference input and voice assistant output each supported as |I2S| or USB (UAC2.0)

This application can be used out of the box as a voice processor solution, or extended to run local wakeword engines.

These applications features a full duplex acoustic echo cancellation stage, which can be provided reference audio via |I2S| or USB audio.  An audio output ASR stream is also available via |I2S| or USB audio.

USB Audio Demonstration
=======================

Direct connection over USB to the host PC allowing signal analysis and evaluation.

**Requirements**

- XK-VOICE-L71 board
- Powered speaker(s) with 3.5mm jack connection
- Host system running Windows, macOS, Linux or Android
- USB A to Micro cable for connection to the host

Hardware Setup
--------------

Connect either end of the ribbon cable to the XTAG4, and the other end to the XK-VOICE-L71 board as shown (Image shows piggybacked connection to RPi. Standalone operation is also supported):

Running the Demonstration
-------------------------

Configure the Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect the host system to the micro-USB socket, and the speakers to the jack plug as shown:

Either mono or stereo speakers may be used.

Flashing the Firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect the XTAG4 via USB to the host computer running the XTC tools, and power on the board (either via RPi or directly via USB).

On the host computer, open a ``XTC Tools Command Prompt``.

.. code-block:: console

    xflash --quad-spi-clock 50MHz --factory example_ffva_ua_adec_altarch.xe --boot-partition-size 0x100000 --data example_ffva_ua_adec_altarch_data_partition.bin

Being returned to the prompt means flashing has completed, and the XTAG4 may be disconnected.

Record Captured Voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Open a music player on host PC, and play a stereo file.

2. Check music is playing through powered speakers.

3. Adjust volume using music player or speakers.

4. Open Audacity and configure to communicate with kit. Input Device: XCORE-VOICE Voice Processor and Output Device: XCORE-VOICE Voice Processor
